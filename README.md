# 100 Days of Code Practice

The idea of this project is to commit yourself to code at least one hour every day in any language you want for a hundred days (at least). The regularity is key here, you need to practice a bit every day, including the weekends. All the challenges present here are medium/hard level. You can (and you should) participate even if you don't have much experience with coding, it will only take a bit longer. Most of the challenges can be solved in three hours or less.

## Rules

The main rule is:

- Code at least an hour every day (don't skip weekends/holidays)
- Choose a language you want to learn or improve
- Share your progress daily in your social media
- Don't copy code from the internet
- Try to come up with a clean and elegant solution
- Always write tests (and make them pass)
